# Modular Calculator

## What?

A calculator app with seperate GUI and back end. GUI to be implemented later. Backend will include a TUI if executed directly. Or it can be used like an API that takes a string that is a valid mathematical expression and returns the result. This will allow others to create their own calculator GUIs without having to implement logic for parsing, order of operations, etc.
